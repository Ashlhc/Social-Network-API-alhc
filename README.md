## Description
This project is a social network API using NoSQL, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It will allow you to create a User, Add Friends, Create Thoughts, and even React to other people's Thoughts. 
This project was extremely difficult at the beginning. I had to get some advice from friend's on how to build this but I'm rather pleased with how well it turned out though. 
## Installation
You'll need to clone the repository, run npm i command, use your terminal to run the command mongodb, and then finally use the command npm start.
## Usage
